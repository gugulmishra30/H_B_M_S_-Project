## 🔁 Business Flow – Hotel Booking Management System:-
This section explains how the business process works from a user and hotel staff perspective.

### 👥 Actors Involved:
- **Customer** – User who wants to book a hotel room.
- **Receptionist / Hotel Staff** – Handles room bookings and manages customer records.
- **Admin** – Manages rooms, staff, and has full control of the system.


### 📈 Business Flow Steps:-

1. **Customer Enquiry / Walk-in / Online Access**
   - Customer checks available rooms either online or at the hotel counter.

2. **Room Search & Selection**
   - Staff or customer filters rooms based on room type, availability, and date range.

3. **Customer Details Entry**
   - Staff adds customer name, contact info, ID proof, check-in/check-out dates.

4. **Room Booking**
   - Booking entry is created in the system.
   - Room status is marked as “Booked”.
   - Confirmation is generated (can be printed or viewed in UI).

5. **Invoice Generation**
   - After check-out, the system calculates billing details (duration, price per night, taxes).
   - Invoice is generated and stored against customer record.

6. **Room Status Update**
   - After checkout, room is marked as “Available” again.

7. **Admin Operations**
   - Add/edit/delete rooms.
   - Manage hotel staff accounts.
   - Monitor all bookings and customers.
   - Download reports or check logs.


### 🔐 Access Control (Role-Based):
| Role         | Allowed Modules                          |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Admin        | All modules (rooms, staff, booking, logs) |
| Receptionist | Bookings, Customer, Invoice               |
| Customer     | View availability (if public)             |


💡 This flow ensures:-
- Efficient tracking of room usage
- No double-booking issues
- Full control via Admin panel
- Accurate billing & customer history

## ✅⚙️ Technical Flow – Hotel Booking Management System:-

This section explains how the application works behind the scenes — from the moment a request hits the system to how data is processed and stored.

### 🧭 Request Lifecycle:-
Client (Browser / Postman) -> Spring MVC Controller (@Controller / @RestController) -> Service Layer (@Service) -> Data Access Layer (Repository / DAO) -> Database (MySQL)


### 🔍 Component Breakdown:
#### 1️⃣ Controller Layer (`@RestController` or `@Controller`):-
- Handles incoming HTTP requests.
- Maps URLs to Java methods using `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, etc.
- Calls service layer methods.
- Returns views (for JSP) or JSON response (for REST).

``java
@GetMapping("/rooms")
public List<Room> getAllRooms() {
    return roomService.getAllRooms();
}

#### 2️⃣ Service Layer (@Service):-
Contains business logic.
Handles validations, calculations, and transformations.
Interacts with repository (DAO) to access DB.
Ensures separation of concerns.

''java
public List<Room> getAllRooms() {
    return roomRepository.findAll();
}

#### 3️⃣ Repository Layer (@Repository):-
Interfaces extending Spring Data JPA’s JpaRepository.
Handles CRUD operations with zero SQL code.
Automatically translates method names into SQL queries.

''java
public interface RoomRepository extends JpaRepository<Room, Long> {
    List<Room> findByStatus(String status);
}

#### 4️⃣ Database Layer (MySQL):-
Stores all persistent data (rooms, bookings, customers, users, etc.).
Schema usually created using JPA annotations or schema.sql.

#### 🔁 Data Flow Example: Room Booking:-
User submits booking form from frontend (/bookings)
Controller receives request and passes it to service layer
Service performs validations, updates room status, and saves booking
Repository saves data to MySQL
Response is returned to the user (confirmation page or API response)

#### 🧰 Tools Involved:-
Layer	Technology Used
Controller	Spring MVC (@Controller, @RestController)
Service	Spring Framework (@Service)
Repository	Spring Data JPA (@Repository)
View (Web)	JSP + JSTL
Persistence	Hibernate + JPA
Database	MySQL

💡 This structure follows MVC + Service + DAO pattern, ensuring scalability, readability, and separation of concerns.

🧩 Basic Swagger Configuration:-

@Configuration
@EnableOpenApi
public class SwaggerConfig {
    @Bean
    public Docket api() {
        return new Docket(DocumentationType.OAS_30)
                .select()
                .apis(RequestHandlerSelectors.basePackage("com.example.hotel"))
                .paths(PathSelectors.any())
                .build();
    }
}

@RequestMapping("/bookings")
@Api(value = "Booking Controller", tags = "Bookings")
public class BookingController {
    @ApiOperation(value = "Get all bookings", response = List.class)
    @GetMapping
    public List<Booking> getAllBookings() {
        return bookingService.getAllBookings();
    }
}
